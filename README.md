# Polar Opposite Map
What is on the exact other side of the planet

![Looking at Antipodes Island](https://raw.github.com/andrejewski/polar-opposite-map/master/screenshot.png)

The correct term is [Antipodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipodes) but everyone is already dominating the Google search pages for that. I have been wanting to make this for awhile. It seems to be the only one that is real-time.

Unfortunately where I live didn't give me any good results. Most places are polar opposites with water, which is not too exciting.
